Belly Button Biological Diversity Research

## Module 12 Challenge.
Roza has a partially completed dashboard, but she needs to finish it. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Rozaâ€™s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Resources
- Input: samples.json
- Software: Javascript, VS Code,  Bootstrap

## Website info:
Website plots out information contained in samples.json to visualise the sampling of biological material from peoples belly buttons. Each individual is coded with an ID number. Select ID number from the dropdown menu, and the appropriate info will be displayed


## Recomendations
The website could use with more biological information; links to descriptions of the various baceria and what they do would be useful.

Ability to look up samples by location, age, or even washing frequency could help with understanding all of the data.
